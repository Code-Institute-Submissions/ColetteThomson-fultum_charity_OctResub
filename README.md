### Design of the Fultum Wiltshire Charity website

#### Colour Scheme
The colour palette chosen consists of four basic colours:  #ce5108 (orange); #0463bb (blue); #ffca4b (yellow); and #80000 (maroon). The body text colour is mostly #3a3a3a (dark grey) with some sections in #000000 (black).  The colours were chosen to compliment each other and provide the necessary contrast. The colour palette was developed using **Coolors**.

#### Fonts
The logo is using **Shadows Into Light**; all headings are using **Roboto**; and the body text is using **Poppins**.  The back-up font is **sans-serif**.  Fonts were downloaded from **Google Fonts**.

#### Imagery, Icons, Video
Images for the website have been downloaded from **Pexels**.  The social media icons were downloaded from **Font Awesome**.  The MP4 video was downloaded from **All Free Downloads**.

### Limitations
As there is no JavaScript functionality present in this website, the Query Form on the 'Contact Us' page is designed to post to Code Institute's form dump (https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/).

### Features
* The Query Form - this can be completed on the 'Contact Us' page.  
* Masonry Gallery - visible on the 'Get Social' page.
* Embedded video - visible on the 'Get Social' page.  This video is controlled by the user and is not set to automatically play.

## Technologies
* HTML - the structure of this website project uses custom written HTML as the main language.
* CSS - the styling of this website encompasses custom written CSS.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - utilised for the logo (Shadows Into Light); the headings (Roboto) and the body text (Poppins).
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - utilised for the social media icons.
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - utilised for the colour palette design.
* [All Free Downloads](https://all-free-download.com/free-footage/) - utlised for the MP4 video.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - hosting site for storage of source code for the website and [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the deployment of the website.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used as version control software to commit and push code to a GitHub repository where all source code is located.
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - these are built in developer tools used to inspect page elements (eg. responsive design); debug issues; and test different CSS styling options.


## Testing
* This is a static website with no back-end functionality - therefore testing will be performed on visual effect and website layout. 
* Testing will be performed to check for compatibility across three web browsers (Google Chrome; Firefox; and Opera) 
* Responsive design will be tested across the different screen sizes: laptop (max-width 1024px); tablet (max-width 768px); and mobile phones (max-width 426px; max-width 376px; max-width 320px).
* All navigational links should direct to the correct html web page as per their names.  The exception here is the 'Home' page, as it will redirect to 'index.html'.
* All links to external websites (social media links) are to open in a new browser page.
* Testing of the 'Query Form' to ensure correct field input, and that all required fields are completed. 
* Testing of the video link to ensure the user has to click 'play' to run the video and that the video does not play automatically upon opening of the web page.

## Credits
### Code
The private collaboration and knowledge sharing SaaS platform [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was an invaluable resource for general coding queries.

### Content
Inspiration for website content was taken from [Royal Voluntary Service](https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/).  The idea for a charity website was devised from an actual need in my immediate local community.
